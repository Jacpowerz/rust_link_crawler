Run the cargo project and it will ask for a link and depth. Depth is how far it will recursively search within the crawled links.
Note to future self: Not the code I used for the binary on my laptop bc i deleted the dir before pushing it to GitHub

Version 1: main 
Version2 : main 
  commit: "added instep printing"
Version 3: v3
  commit: (check commit log)
Version 4:
  commit: changed the in-step printing to print the found urls for every url in the recursive function
  check the code to understand future me. Compare the recursive function bodies for v3 and v4 to see the difference.
